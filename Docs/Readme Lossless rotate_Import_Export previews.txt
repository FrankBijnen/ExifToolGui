ExifToolGUI 6.2.7

- Removed deprecated functions

Starting with Version 6.2.5 the executables Jhead.exe and Jpegtran.exe are no longer needed. They can however still be used, but the menuitems are marked 'deprecated'.
This change affects: JPG Lossless rotate and Export/Import previews.

In V6.2.5 you will see 2 menu-items for Jpg Lossless rotate: 
- Various/Jpg Lossless autorotate... (Deprecated)
  This is the menu-item that uses Jhead.exe. It will be greyed out if the exe is not available.
  It will continue to function, but will be deleted in a next release.

- Various/Jpg Lossless rotate + crop
  This is the new menu-item. It uses the stripped Delphi library NativeJpg to perform rotating.

  Advantages of this new item.
  - In addition to auto-rotate you can specify 90, 180 and 270 degrees.
  - You can also specify to crop the image size to a multiple of 8, 16. This can be handy when you use other programs that require JPEG's to be a multiple of x.
  - Specify how you want the orientation to be set after rotating.
  - Select an embedded preview to rotate.

  Note: If you don't change the default settings it should work the same as the jhead.exe program.

In V6.2.5 you will see 4 menu-items for Importing (Embedding) and Extracting previews.

Menu-items deprecated. They will continue to function, but will be deleted in a next release.
- Export/Import/Extract preview from selected (Deprecated)
- Export/Import/Embed preview from selected (Deprecated) (Note: It will be greyed out if jpegtran.exe is not available)

New Menu-items.
- Generic extract previews
- Generic import preview

Besides the fact that these functions no longer require an external program (jpegtran.exe) they have additional functionality.

- Extracting.
  Generic. No restrictions imposed.
  You can now see and check the previews available. If you select multiple files, it will show the info for the first selected file.
  Options:
  - Choose to create subdirectories for extracted previews. 
  - Autorotate, and or crop, the previews.

- Importing.
  Generic. No restrictions imposed.
  You can now see the existing preview. The preview that gets overwritten. Info for 1st selected file shown.
  You should check just one (1) preview to import!
  Options:
  - Autorotate, and or crop the selected jpeg's before they are imported.

Important notes:
- Take care when you select multiple files that they have the same characteristics. The info for the preview is only for the 1st selected file.

- I have tried to make these functions as flexible as possible, and thus you can select 'illegal' combinations. Use it sensibly!
  An example is when you try to import a JPG into a PEF file and try to overwrite 'Pentax:Preview', you will get:  Warning: Sorry, Pentax:PreviewImage doesn't exist or isn't writable

Why I think the original menu-items are not 'generic'.

- The original menu-item for Export used the following fixed table for exporting:
  DNG, CR2: PreviewImage
  NEF, NRF, RW2, PEF: JpegFromRaw   

- The original menu-item for Import allowed only CR2 files and always wrote it to PreviewImage

My personal motives for updating these functions: 
- I use DNG files, created by Adobe DNG Converter. Adobe Dng Converter saves a preview in JpegFromRaw, not in PreviewImage.
- I was unable to update the preview in my DNG files, only CR2 was allowed.
